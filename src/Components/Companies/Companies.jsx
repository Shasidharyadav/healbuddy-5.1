                <br/>
                <p>Human body comprises more than 600 muscles. They are the reason why we sit, stand, walk, run and sleep. 
                     Without their optimal strength to carry out these activities of daily living ,
                     We either feel lethargic or experience pain. Our day to day  activities and load on our 
                     body leads to wear and tear. 
                    This needs timely rehabilitation and care to retain optimal muscle  strength and function.
